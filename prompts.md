My task is to create a series of services that simulate temperature data generators, electricity usage, humidity etc.

I should have a consumer that stores this to the influxdb database.

I should also have a graphQL ui to view the data once it is stored.

This should be made from the docker-compose file and the services should be added to this compose file as well. Make the docker files necessary and the python files necessary to run the services.

Errors:

(on aggregator.go)
This file aggregates the values found within the given measurement into min max and sum. However, there is a misunderstanding. The data we are querying on have measurements in the format like the one in sensordata and that is inserted in dataconsumer. These are the values we want to aggreagte, and preferably one aggregation per sensor in a location, as well as per sensortype. Can you make this? Split the aggregation task into seperate files, one per sensortype. humidity, electricity and temperature. Do this even if the files get very small


This python file is able to send emails that I designate. I want this file to listen to subscribe to a nats channel called emails and let other services like the consumer send a message on it. The consumer should send a message with a warning if the temperature is above 30 degrees over a certain period of time. The user should only recieve one email per day, so the consumer should write a json file with the last time it sent an email.

Once the consumer sends a message to the email service, the email service should send an email to the user.
