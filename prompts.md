My task is to create a series of services that simulate temperature data generators, electricity usage, humidity etc.

I should have a consumer that stores this to the influxdb database.

I should also have a graphQL ui to view the data once it is stored.

This should be made from the docker-compose file and the services should be added to this compose file as well. Make the docker files necessary and the python files necessary to run the services.
